### Credits and Info
#### YOLO (You Only Look Once)
YOLO, developed by Joseph Redmon et al., is a state-of-the-art object detection system.
It is known for its speed and accuracy in detecting objects within images and video streams.
YOLO processes images in real-time, making it suitable for applications requiring immediate
response, such as autonomous driving, security systems, and video surveillance.
"Available object detection initialization options are:
yolov8n.pt - nano (3.2M parameters)
yolov8s.pt - small (11.2M parameters)
yolov8m.pt - medium (25.9M parameters)
yolov8l.pt - large (43.7M parameters)
yolov8x.pt - extra-large (68.2M parameters)"


#### OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
It offers a comprehensive set of tools for image processing, video capture,
and analysis, enabling developers to build complex computer vision applications 
effortlessly. OpenCV supports various programming languages and platforms,
making it a popular choice for both academic and industrial projects.


#### Mineral Vision 
Mineral Vision is a versatile application designed for image analysis and real-time object detection. Leveraging the capabilities
of YOLO and OpenCV, Mineral Vision provides users with powerful tools to analyze images and videos. Key features include:
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate and efficient object detection in video streams.
- **Image Analysis**: Offers various image processing features such as grayscale conversion, blurring, edge detection, and more.
- **Plot Generation**: Generates various plots to visualize data derived from image analysis.
- **Data Export**: Provides options to save analysis results and logs for further examination and reporting.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features a clean and intuitive interface powered by `customtkinter` for an enhanced user experience.
